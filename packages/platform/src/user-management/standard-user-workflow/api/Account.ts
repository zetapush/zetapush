 * - personal information about the user (for example: firstname, lastname, email, ...)
 *
 * The manager implementation may be able to handle only particular type
 * of account details. For example, UsernamePasswordAccountCreationManager may be
 * able to handle only UsernamePasswordAccountDetails. If the AccountCreationManager
 * is not able to handle a particular type of AccountCreationDetails, then the manager
 * must return null.
 *
 * Each AccountCreationManager may be configured to use an AccountDetailsProvider that
 * may add additional "static" account information just before account creation. For
 * example, front can provide 3 fields (email, firstname, lastname) through AccountCreationDetails
 * and the AccountDetailsProvider could add extra fields (role for example). AccountDetailsProvider
 * could also be used to completely rewrite the object sent by the front.
 *
 * Likewise, each AccountCreationManager may be configured to set initial account status
 * through an AccountStatusProvider. The aim is to be able to control the account lifecycle.
